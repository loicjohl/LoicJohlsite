  <p class="Desc">
    Loic Johl is a Canadian artist whose prime goal in his art is to innovate and "bring listeners to another world".
    Primarily a bassist, who has been playing since he was a child, alongside teaching himself how to produce and
    mix his own music around a similar age, Loic has carefully crafted his sound over years, linking to his own
    self-development as a human and his technical proficiency. His music is almost entirely made with the bass,
    using creative ways to layer this instrument alongside luscious vocals and introspective lyrics, creating a
    unique experience for listeners. Anyone who is an outcast, alternative, struggles with their own mind, the
    world around them and prides themselves on non-conformity will find solace in Loic Johlâ€™s music.
